## Maps and Legends

This site is an example of using jekyll to drive map visualizations; I created it to get my personal map data out of google's clutches and into text files I can access with UNIX tools the way god intended.

## Features
* Use Jekyll collections for each location
* Use leaflet for map integration
* Easily import data from mymaps.google.com (export to kmz and then run through included python script; see `bin` directory)
* Use leaflet awesome-markers for colorful icons
* Use marker-clusters / featuregroup.subgroup for automatic and sensible clustering

## TODO
See `TODO`
