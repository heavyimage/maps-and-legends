cosmetic:
    fullscreen map!


auto fit bounds to selection of points:
    var group = new L.featureGroup([marker1, marker2, marker3]);
    map.fitBounds(group.getBounds());

content:
    brookyln strategist!
    for-real data import from various mymaps repos
        fix script to import spaces as underscores!
    store multiple branches of one location in the same file or one file per?
    per-location metadata:
        formalize recommender of location (hannah, lisa etc)
        add whether I've visited or not
        date added...?
        categorize restaurants!
    size based on essentialness?

what to do on detail pages:
    use places API:
        figure out how to pull in POI metadata
    should I even show a map?  if so -- disable layers / clustering
    pull out quotes nice and big?
    display {{content}}

input methods:
    easy way to add new locations, perhaps via binscript:
        * find lat / lon
        * scrape from google?

Generate kml file from database
    whenever we build, use liquidt o create a servable kml file for others to import

cbbs:
    rather than hard code the overlays, drive this from the jekyll config
    RSS feed of recent locations (last_modified_at sucks!)
